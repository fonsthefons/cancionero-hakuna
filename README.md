# Cancionero Hakuna

The songs of **Hakuna Group Music** with chords for guitar, as **one web page**: `index.html`.
The songs come from the printed *Cancionero Hakuna Group Music 2026* and are grouped
by album, in the songbook's order.

- Live at **https://fonsthefons.github.io/cancionero-hakuna/** (works on phone, iPad and laptop).
- The whole book is a single file with nothing to download separately, so once
  the page is saved in the browser it works without internet.
- Added to the home screen, it opens offline too (see *Using the book*).
- Songs are plain text files in `songs/`. A small Python program turns them into
  `index.html`, and GitHub Pages publishes that file whenever it changes.

## Quick start

| I want to... | Run |
|---|---|
| Set up my laptop (once) | see [Setup](#setup) |
| Add a song (from a link, a search, or pasted) | `venv/bin/python add_song.py` |
| Add a list of songs | `venv/bin/python add_songs.py Want.txt --section Want --report Checked.txt` |
| Rebuild the book after editing a song by hand | `venv/bin/python build.py` |
| See the result | open `index.html` in a browser (double-click it) |
| Publish it to the website | `git add -A`, `git commit -m "Add <song>"`, `git push` |

Run every command from inside the `cancionero-hakuna` folder. On Windows, write
`venv\Scripts\python` instead of `venv/bin/python`.

## Setup

You need:

- **Python 3.10 or newer.** Check with `python3 --version` (Windows: `py --version`).
  If it's missing or older, install it from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
- **Git.** Check with `git --version`. If it's missing, install it from
  https://git-scm.com/downloads (on a Mac, running `git` offers to install it).
- To publish: a GitHub account with write access to this repository.

Then, in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fonsthefons/cancionero-hakuna.git
cd cancionero-hakuna
python3 -m venv venv
venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
venv/bin/python build.py
```

(On Windows, use `py -m venv venv` and `venv\Scripts\pip` / `venv\Scripts\python`.)

The last command should print `Built index.html: ... songs`. You're ready.
`venv/` is a private folder with this project's Python packages. It is not
shared through Git, so every laptop creates its own with the commands above.

## Publishing

The website shows whatever `index.html` is on GitHub. After adding or editing songs:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Add Huracán"
git push
```

About a minute later the site is updated. Reload the page on your phone to see
it; if it still shows the old version, close the tab and open it again.
Always commit the song files and `index.html` together.

## Adding a song

### With the script (recommended)

```bash
venv/bin/python add_song.py
```

It needs an internet connection and offers three ways in:

1. **Link**: paste the address of the song's page on Ultimate Guitar,
   Cifra Club, LaCuerda, or another site that shows the song as plain text.
   The path of a page saved from the browser also works.
2. **Paste**: paste the song (chords above the lyrics), then type `END` on its own line.
3. **Search**: type the title (the artist is Hakuna unless you type another). It searches the web (DuckDuckGo)
   and Ultimate Guitar and lists the best chord pages, your three sites first.
   Enter takes the first; if a page can't be read, or you say the preview
   looks wrong, the list comes back so you can try the next one.

It then:

- **tidies the song**: spaces instead of tabs, no invisible or odd characters,
  section labels (`[Chorus]`, `Estribillo:`...) removed, `Intro:` with its chords
  at the top (when the song has none, it adds one with the first chord: change
  it if needed), capo read from the page when it has one; from web pages it
  also drops comments people leave (greetings, e-mails, "música y letra..."),
  titles above the first chords and chord-less text after the song;
- **turns Spanish chord names into letters** (`LAm` → `Am`, `SOL` → `G`,
  `Sib` → `Bb`; in the "DO mi" style, lower case means minor), keeping every
  chord over its letter;
- **shows you the result** and asks if it looks right;
- **asks for the details**: title (it warns if the song is already in the
  book), author (Hakuna unless you change it; Hakuna isn't written in the
  file or shown in the book), capo, Spotify link and album tag (pick a number);
- **finds the Spotify link**: it offers the matching tracks it finds, each one
  checked with Spotify itself. Enter takes the first, a number picks another,
  `-` means none, or paste your own link;
- **writes** `songs/<title>.md` (`songs/<title>_<author>.md` for another
  artist) and **rebuilds** `index.html`.

Then open `index.html` to check the song, and [publish](#publishing).
If something needs fixing, edit the song file (see below) and run
`venv/bin/python build.py` again.

Good to know:

- **Author names**: if you change an author's name (e.g. "Hakuna Group Music" →
  "Hakuna"), the script remembers it in `author_aliases.yaml` and offers your
  version next time.
- **Cifra Club** only opens in a real browser. The first time you use it, the
  script offers to install a hidden one (about 100 MB, once).
- **Doubtful lines**: when pasting, a line like "La la la" could be lyrics or
  chords, so the script asks. Enter means chords; type `n` when it's lyrics.
- **"The web search is busy"**: after many searches in a short time the search
  asks to prove you're human. Wait a few minutes, or use a link instead.
- `venv/bin/python add_song.py --help` lists the options (`--no-build`, `--offline`).

### Many songs at once

Write the songs in a text file, one per line as `Title` (a Hakuna song) or
`Title - Artist`, then:

```bash
venv/bin/python add_songs.py Want.txt --section Want --report Checked.txt
```

It does the same as the search option of `add_song.py` for each song, but
without questions: it picks the best chord page, cleans the song, finds a
Spotify link (or a YouTube one if the song isn't on Spotify), writes the file
with **no tags** (add them by hand) and rebuilds the book. When it isn't sure,
it creates nothing and says why: the song is already in the book, no chord page
with that title (and artist) was found, or, with no artist given, the pages
found are by different artists. Then add the artist and try again.

- `--section Want` reads only the lines under a `Want` heading, so other
  sections (e.g. `NOT YET:`) can stay in the same file.
- `--report Checked.txt` adds the results to that file, under `claude-added:`
  and `claude-uncertain:` (with the reasons).
- It pauses between songs so the web search doesn't get busy: about half a
  minute per song.

Check each new song in `index.html` before publishing: chord sites sometimes
contain mistakes, and comments people leave on them are removed only when
they look like comments.

### By hand

1. Copy `song_template.md` to `songs/<title>.md`
   (lowercase, `_` instead of spaces, no accents; e.g. `songs/olor_a_tostadas.md`).
2. Fill in the details at the top and paste the lyrics with chords.
3. Run `venv/bin/python build.py`, check `index.html`, and [publish](#publishing).

The build checks every song and stops with a list of every problem
(unknown tag, typo in a field name, broken formatting...), so mistakes don't slip in silently.

### The details at the top of a song file

```yaml
---
title: Olor a tostadas      # required
capo: "2"                   # optional, free text
link: "https://..."         # optional, Spotify or other recording (must start with http)
song_tags:                  # optional, the album: see "Tags" below
  capricho: []
autor: Someone              # optional, only for songs not by Hakuna (shown next to the title)
---
```

Songs are numbered automatically, alphabetically by title in Spanish order:
accents, capitals and punctuation are ignored (*Déjate* sorts as *dejate*,
*¿Por qué?* as *por que*), and ñ comes after n.

### Lyrics and chords

Write chords on their own line, above the lyric they belong to, aligned with
**spaces**. A line counts as a chord line when every word on it is a chord
(`G`, `Am`, `C#m7`, `Bb`, `Dsus4`, `D/F#`...), a separator (`|`, `-`, `(`, `)`)
or a repeat mark (`x2`, `(x4)`).
A blank line starts a new verse. A line with only `**` starts or ends a
**bold** part (the choruses, as in the printed songbook); it can span verses.

```
G              C
First line of lyrics

**
D              G
Chorus line, shown in bold
**
```

Your spacing is kept exactly: the book uses a fixed-width font and never wraps
lines, so a chord is always shown over the same letter as in the file, at any
text size or zoom. Prefer spaces over tabs, because a tab's width depends on
the editor (the book counts a tab as 2 spaces).

## Tags

The tags are Hakuna's albums, defined in **`tags.yaml`** in the songbook's
order. That file is the only place to edit when adding, renaming or reordering
them; the book follows its order, and `add_song.py` lists them from there.
Inside an album, songs are listed alphabetically.

| Tag | Album |
|-----|-------|
| `hakuna` | Hakuna |
| `mi_pobre_loco` | Mi pobre loco |
| `pasion` | Pasión |
| `sencillamente` | Sencillamente |
| `qaos` | Qaos |
| `capricho` | Capricho |
| `el_arte_de_vivir` | El arte de vivir |
| `tu` | Tú |
| `misa` | Misa |
| `villancicos` | Villancicos HKN |
| `otras_hkn` | Otras canciones HKN |
| `hora_santa` | Hora Santa |
| `otras_misa` | Otras canciones de Misa |

Albums have no subtags, so a song uses `<album>: []`. Tags can still have
subtags (see the comment in `tags.yaml`); a tag with subtags needs at least one.
A song without tags only appears in *All Songs*.

## Using the book

- **On the home screen, offline**: in Safari, Share → *Add to Home Screen*
  (Android Chrome: ⋮ → *Add to home screen*). Open it once with internet;
  from then on it opens without internet too (airplane mode, no signal).
  With internet it always shows the newest book and saves it for next time.
  (A home-screen app has its own storage: a copy in Safari's Reading List
  isn't used by it.) The first visit in a browser shows a one-time popup
  with these two steps (`web/js/install-tip.js`).
- **☰ menu**: contents, plus settings: text size (A− / A+), chords and
  columns for the whole book, chord names (*C D E* or *Do Re Mi*: Am → Lam,
  D/F# → Re/Fa#), light/dark theme, keep the screen on, print.
  Settings are remembered on each device.
- **Search** (top bar, and the Sing Session box): type a song number, or any
  words from the title, author or lyrics, in any order and without accents
  ("dios debil", "senor ten"); the start of a word is enough. Title matches
  come first, then authors, then lyrics, which show the line they were found in.
- **Sing Session** (first in the ☰ menu): a list of songs to practise or play.
  Add songs with its search box or the **+ Session** button on any song;
  reorder by dragging the **⠿** handle (or ↑/↓ keys on a focused handle),
  remove with ✕ (or tap **✓ In session** on the song), and
  *Clear session* empties it. Tap a song in the list to jump to it. Remembered
  on each device.
- **Autoscroll** (top bar): ▶/⏸ starts and stops, − / + change the speed
  (1–10, remembered). Scrolling by hand or jumping to a song while it runs
  continues from there; it pauses while the menu is open and stops at the end.
- **Per song**: show/hide chords, transpose (tap the number to reset), 1 or 2 columns.
  These are remembered per song on each device (e.g. Huracán stays at +3);
  ☰ → *Song changes → Reset all* puts every song back as written.
- **Text size**: each song is sized so its longest line fits the screen.
  A− / A+ scale that up or down; pinch-zoom always works too.
- **Printing / PDF** (☰ → Print, or the browser's print): the index is always
  printed fully unfolded, its entries are clickable links to the songs inside
  the PDF, and each song's *Link* stays a clickable web link. Every song starts
  at the top of a new page (a long song continues onto the next pages).
- **Transposing** keeps every chord on its letter. Only when two chords are a
  single space apart (e.g. `D Em` → `D# Fm`) does the second one shift by the
  one column it needs. The same applies to *Do Re Mi* names, which are longer.
- **Intro / Solo / Final / Punteo / Outro / Puente lines** (`Intro: G Em C D`):
  the chords after the label are real chords, so they transpose and change
  names too.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to do |
|---|---|
| `python3: command not found`, or a version below 3.10 | Install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/, then redo the setup. |
| `No such file or directory: venv/bin/python` | You're not in the `cancionero-hakuna` folder (`cd cancionero-hakuna`), or the setup wasn't run. |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml'` | Run `venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`. |
| The build prints `Invalid songs:` | It lists each file and what's wrong (e.g. an unknown tag). Fix those files and build again. |
| `git push` is refused | Run `git pull` first, then push again. If it says "permission denied", ask the owner for write access. |
| The website still shows the old book | Wait a minute after pushing, then close and reopen the page. |
| The home-screen app says there's no internet | Open it once while online (it saves the book then). If it was added before offline support existed, open it online once, close it fully and reopen. |
| `add_song.py` can't read a page | Pick another search result, or open the page, copy the song and use option 2 (paste). |

## How it works

This part is for changing the program itself; it isn't needed to add songs.

```
songs/*.md ─┐
tags.yaml  ─┼─► build.py ─► index.html   (single file, CSS + JS inlined)
web/       ─┘
```

| Path | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `build.py` | Entry point: loads, validates, renders, writes `index.html` |
| `add_song.py` | Asks for a link, a search or a pasted song, writes the song file, rebuilds |
| `add_songs.py` | Adds a list of songs without questions (search, choose, clean, link), rebuilds |
| `importer/read.py` | Reads a song from a link (site reader, redirects, browser engine when blocked) |
| `importer/youtube.py` | Finds a YouTube video for songs not on Spotify (checked with YouTube's oEmbed) |
| `importer/sites/` | One reader per website (`ultimate_guitar.py`, `cifraclub.py`, `lacuerda.py`, `generic.py`); add a module and list it in `SITES` to support a new site (the list order is also the search preference) |
| `importer/clean.py`, `chords.py`, `fetch.py` | Text cleanup, Spanish chord names → letters (keeping columns), downloading |
| `importer/search.py` | Finds chord pages for a title + artist (DuckDuckGo + Ultimate Guitar search) |
| `importer/spotify.py` | Finds the song's Spotify track (web search, checked on Spotify's embed page) |
| `author_aliases.yaml` | Author names as sites write them → as the book writes them |
| `builder/songs.py` | Reads song files (frontmatter + lyrics), validates fields, sorts in Spanish order |
| `builder/tags.py` | Loads `tags.yaml`, validates song tags, groups songs by tag |
| `builder/lyrics.py` | Detects chord lines and turns lyrics into HTML |
| `builder/render.py` | Builds the HTML fragments and fills `web/template.html` |
| `web/template.html` | Page layout, with `{{ placeholders }}` filled by the build; also holds the Hakuna logo (an inline SVG drawn in the text colour, so it follows the dark theme) |
| `web/song-controls.html` | Buttons shown above each song |
| `web/styles.css` | All styles (theme colours and sizes are variables at the top) |
| `web/js/core.js` | Shared helpers: `onAction`, `songSetting`, `prefs` (saved settings), `songState` (saved per-song changes) |
| `web/js/display.js` | Chords, columns, text size, theme |
| `web/js/transpose.js` | Transposition that keeps chords in their columns, and the chord-names setting (C D E / Do Re Mi) |
| `web/js/install-tip.js` | First-visit popup: how to add the book to the home screen (hosted site only, once per browser) |
| `web/js/autoscroll.js` | Autoscroll (speed settings at the top of the file) |
| `web/js/search.js` | Song search (number, title, author, lyrics; ranked, with the matching line) |
| `web/js/session.js` | Sing Session (list in the menu, + Session buttons) |
| `web/js/session-drag.js` | Drag-and-drop reordering of the session (pointer events) |
| `web/js/drawer.js`, `index.js`, `print.js`, `wake-lock.js` | One feature each |
| `web/js/offline.js`, `sw.js` | Offline home-screen app: `offline.js` registers the service worker `sw.js` (hosted site only), which saves the book and shows the saved copy when there's no internet (or after 4 s of slow network). Not inlined: `sw.js` must be its own file at the root |
| `manifest.webmanifest`, `icon-180.png`, `icon-512.png` | Home-screen name, icon and full-screen mode |
| `song_template.md` | Starting point for a song written by hand |
| `PROGRESS.md` | Log of what was changed and why |

### Adding a browser feature

1. Add a button with a `data-action` attribute (in `web/template.html` or
   `web/song-controls.html`):
   `<button data-action="my-feature">...</button>`
2. Create `web/js/my-feature.js` and register a handler. It receives the button
   and the song it belongs to (or `null`):
   ```js
   onAction("my-feature", (button, song) => { ... });
   ```
3. Rebuild. Every file in `web/js/` is included automatically (`core.js` first).

A `.search` box with `data-search="<action>"` turns its results into buttons
that run that action with `data-song="<song id>"` (the Sing Session box uses
`session-add`); without it, results jump to the song.

For a show/hide or on/off option that works per song *and* for the whole book,
use `songSetting(name, [default, alternative], onGlobalChange)` from `core.js`,
as `web/js/display.js` does for chords and columns. It stores the value in
`data-<name>` on `<body>` (whole book) and on `.song` (one-song override), CSS
styles both, and the book-wide value is remembered on the device. For any other
remembered value use `prefs.get(key, fallback)` / `prefs.set(key, value)`, or
`songState.get(song, key)` / `songState.set(song, key, value)` for a value that
belongs to one song (`null` forgets it). Saved data is keyed by the song's file
name, so renaming a song file forgets its saved changes.

Never add CSS that changes how lyric lines lay out horizontally (wrapping,
`letter-spacing`, proportional fonts, per-character styling that changes
width): it would move chords off their letters.
