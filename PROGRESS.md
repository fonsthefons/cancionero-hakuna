# Progress

## 2026-10-12 — New book: Cancionero Hakuna (repo `cancionero-hakuna`)

User's choices (asked up front): create GitHub repo + push + Pages; songs in two albums
stored as separate songs ("Un Dios débil (Hakuna)/(Pasión)", "Aleluya (Tú)/(Misa)");
Pasión roman numerals dropped; choruses bold; Spotify links looked up; PDF line wraps
rejoined; app name/icon "Cancionero Hakuna" with the H logo; add_song tools kept.

### Songs from the PDF (scripts in `scratch/hkn_*.py`)
- `hkn_lines.py` (pdfplumber): every text line with font, bold, column and each
  character's x position. `hkn_parse.py`: splits songs on "N. TITLE" headings, capo
  from "Cejilla N…", chords placed over the letter at the same x in the lyric line
  below (monospace columns), bold lines flagged, wrapped lines rejoined. A line is
  rejoined only when the next word could not have fit (Word-style wrap) AND: it ends
  on a word a line never ends on (de, la, tu, que…), or the next line is a short
  remainder (lower case, or Ti/Dios/Señor…). Rejoined lines over 50 characters are
  split again at the comma nearest the middle (else where the PDF broke them).
  Fixes: "Fm#" → "F#m", Spanish chord names (DO, MIm, SI7: songs 122, 126) → letters,
  INTRO/PUENTE/ESTRIBILLO… → Intro/Puente/Estribillo, "(X2)" → "(x2)".
- `hkn_check.py`: every chord line is a chord line for the book and no lyric line is
  (0 problems). Spot-checked songs 1–15, 31, 42, 44, 65, 100 against the PDF pages.
- `hkn_write.py`: 126 files `songs/<title>.md`, titles written by hand in normal case,
  one album tag each (from the PDF's contents pages), choruses between `**` lines.
- All old songs removed (`git rm -r songs`).

### Book changes
- `tags.yaml`: the 13 albums in PDF order (flat tags). Inside an album: alphabetical.
- `builder/lyrics.py`: a line with only `**` toggles bold (`.lyric-line.bold`; bold
  monospace keeps widths, as chords already do); repeat marks (`x2`, `(x4)`) allowed
  on chord lines. `builder/songs.py`: punctuation ignored when sorting (¿Por qué?, (Tú)…).
- Logo: the cover's H redrawn as an inline SVG (`web/template.html`, colour follows the
  theme): small in the top bar (stays on phones), large with "GROUP MUSIC" and
  "Cancionero / Hakuna Group Music" above the contents. Title "Cancionero Hakuna".
- Icons (`scratch/hkn_icons.py`): dark H on white. Manifest name "Cancionero Hakuna".
- Same site as the original book (fonsthefons.github.io): saved data now uses keys
  `cancionero-hakuna.*` and the service worker cache `cancionero-hakuna-v1`, and it only
  deletes its own old caches. The ORIGINAL repo's sw.js still deletes every other cache
  when it updates (could wipe this book's offline copy until the next online visit):
  worth the same one-line fix there (not done: outside this repo).
- `add_song.py` / `add_songs.py`: artist defaults to Hakuna; Hakuna songs get no `autor`
  and are named `<title>.md`. README, `song_template.md` updated.

### Checks
- `scratch/hkn_ui_test.py` (copy of ui_test.py pointed at Hakuna songs): all pass in
  Chromium and WebKit, phone/iPad/laptop: 5,493 chords / 6,556 lines exactly aligned
  (1 and 2 columns, 40% and 250% text), 60,423 transposed chord positions, session,
  persistence, autoscroll, search, menu, print dialog, no JS errors.
- `scratch/hkn_offline_test.py` (offline_test.py with the new title): all pass.
- `scratch/hkn_tools_check.py`: add_song/add_songs Hakuna defaults. `hkn_shots.py`: screenshots.

### Spotify links (98 of 126)
- First publish went out before the per-song lookup (`hkn_links.py`, a web search per song,
  ~1.5 min each) had finished, so most songs had no link. The user noticed.
- Faster and more exact (`hkn_album_links.py`): one web search per album finds its Spotify
  album page; the album's embed page lists every track; songs matched by title within
  their own album. All 8 studio albums found: 92 songs get the album's own track
  (e.g. "Cirineo (Estación V)"). It also fixed "Gloria", which the per-song search
  had matched to "El Rey de la Gloria".
- Per-song search for the rest: Hoy en Belén, Del cielo, Juntos, Lo imposible (Hakuna
  singles); Cara a cara (Marcos Vidal) and Lord I Need You (Matt Maher), covers in Hora Santa.
- No link (28): the Misa parts (no Misa album on Spotify), Gloria, Aleluya (Misa), Papá,
  ¿Para quién soy yo?, Lo tienes delante, Que todo sea verdad, most of Hora Santa and Otras
  canciones de Misa. Report: `scratch/hkn/album_links_report.txt`.

### Notes / blocked
- The copied `venv/` belongs to the original repo (its pip installs into
  `../cancionero/venv`): my first `pip install pdfplumber` landed there by accident
  (harmless extra packages in the original's venv). Created `.venv/` here instead and
  used it for everything else (pyyaml, pdfplumber, pypdf, playwright).
- `venv/bin/python` in README still works on a fresh clone (each laptop makes its own).

## 2026-10-11 — Refactor for maintainability

### Phase 1: understand the repo
- Read `build.py`, `assets.js`, `book.css`, `README.md`, `indexes/*.md`; sampled song files.
- Found: one song silently untagged (mis-indented YAML), a `..md` filename, `fname`
  duplicating the filename (and mismatching in one song), unused `capo_notes`,
  first chord line losing its indentation, slash chords transposed wrongly,
  committed build artefacts (`output/`, `__pycache__/`, stale `search-index.json`).

### Phase 2: refactor
- **Song data** (`songs/`): removed `fname` (145 files) and `capo_notes` (62 files);
  fixed tag indentation in `sopla_senor_popular.md`; renamed
  `no_temas_jaime_olguin..md` → `no_temas_jaime_olguin.md`.
- **Build**: `build.py` is now a thin entry point over `builder/`
  (`songs.py`, `tags.py`, `lyrics.py`, `render.py`). Tags live in `tags.yaml`.
  Unknown fields, bad tags and broken YAML now stop the build with a full error list.
  Song anchors are `song-<filename>` (stable when songs are added).
- **Web**: `web/template.html` (layout), `web/song-controls.html`,
  `web/styles.css`, `web/js/*.js` (one file per feature, `core.js` first).
  Search is built from the page itself, so lyrics are no longer duplicated in a JSON blob.
  Output went from 1.73 MB to 0.98 MB.
- **Removed**: Obsidian `indexes/`, `output/`, `__pycache__/`, `search-index.json`,
  `book.css`, `assets.js`. Added `.gitignore`, `song_template.md`, new `README.md`.
- Moved `songs/CLAUDE.md` to the repo root (the build treats every `.md` in `songs/` as a song).

### Verification (all scripts in `scratch/`, gitignored)
- `run_old_build.py` + `extract.py` + `compare.py`: old vs new build, per song
  (heading, meta, every chord/lyric line and chord). Only differences:
  first chord line indentation restored in 4 songs (bug fix), and the order of the two
  songs titled "Aleluya" (now deterministic: by file name).
- `compare_index.py`: tag index identical except "Sopla Señor" now listed under its 3 tags.
- `test_validation.py`: 9 kinds of broken song files all reported correctly.
- `run_browser_test.py` (Playwright, headless Chromium): 29 UI checks pass
  (chords, columns, transpose incl. `D/F#`→`E/G#`, search, sidebar, links, print dialog), no JS errors.

### Main commands
- `venv/bin/python build.py`
- `venv/bin/pip install playwright` (test-only, not in `requirements.txt`);
  Chromium downloaded to `scratch/browsers/`.

### Blocked
- Arc browser ignores `--headless`, so it could not be used for tests; used Playwright instead.

### Phase 3: commit and merge
- Committed on branch `refactor/maintainable-build` (c89ad2f), opened
  https://github.com/fonsthefons/cancionero/pull/1 and merged it into `main` (4dedfda).
- Local `main` fast-forwarded; feature branch deleted locally and on GitHub.
- `.claude/settings.json` (local Claude Code permissions) was left uncommitted on purpose.

## 2026-10-11 — Phone / iPad / laptop experience

### Audit (scratch/mobile_audit.py, line_lengths.py, alignment_risks.py)
- Phone rendered the page 575px wide on a 390px screen (`min-width: fit-content`
  on body), causing zoomed-out text and sideways wobble.
- First song ~13,000px down; floating `<` button covered content; per-song buttons
  overflowed; search input 13px (iOS zooms on focus); sticky hover states on touch.
- Widest lyric line per song: median 40 chars, max 63.
- Alignment risks: 57 combining accents (now NFC-joined, same columns);
  `viva_cristo_rey_jaire.md` uses tabs (kept at width 2 as before; review by hand).

### Changes
- Lyrics size themselves per song so the widest line fits the screen
  (`--chars` from the build + CSS container units), capped at 15px; A−/A+ scale it.
  Pinch-zoom always allowed. Lines never wrap; if made bigger than the screen,
  the song scrolls sideways inside its box, never the page.
- Top bar (menu, title, search) replaces the floating button; menu drawer holds
  the contents and settings (text size, chords, columns, theme, keep screen on, print).
- Index sections and subsections are collapsible, open by default; links into a
  folded section unfold it.
- Transposition keeps every chord on its column, absorbing longer/shorter chord
  names in the following spaces (also after `(`/`)` separators).
- Settings remembered per device (localStorage, guarded). Dark theme (auto/light/dark).
- New files: `web/js/drawer.js`, `index.js`, `wake-lock.js`; removed `sidebar.js`.

### Verification
- `scratch/ui_test.py` (Playwright, Chromium + WebKit, phone 390px / iPad 820px /
  laptop 1440px): all 8,778 chords on their exact pixel column in 1 and 2 columns
  and at 40% / 250% text; every song fits; page never scrolls sideways; 96,558
  transposed chord positions checked: shifts only where chords are one space
  apart or glued (`C#m-Bm`); back to 0 restores every line; all UI features pass;
  no JS errors.
- `scratch/compare.py`: every chord/lyric line still identical to the original build.
- Tools: `venv/bin/python -m playwright install webkit` (into `scratch/browsers/`).
- Merged as PR #2 and deployed to https://fonsthefons.github.io/cancionero/ (live file
  verified identical to the local build).

## 2026-10-11 — Autoscroll

- `web/js/autoscroll.js` + top-bar group: ▶/⏸, −, speed number, +. Speed 1–10
  (6 px/s per step, default 3), remembered per device. Smooth requestAnimationFrame
  scrolling with fractional positions; follows manual scrolls/jumps; pauses while the
  menu is open; stops at the end of the page.
- On screens ≤ 560px the "Cancionero" title is hidden to make room (Contenido is in
  the menu) and search results span the screen width.
- `scratch/ui_test.py`: 10 new autoscroll checks + top-bar fit on phone/iPad/laptop;
  full suite passes in Chromium and WebKit.
- Merged as PR #3 and deployed (live file verified identical).

## 2026-10-11 — Remember per-song changes

- `songState` in `web/js/core.js`: per-song transpose / chords / columns saved in
  localStorage (`cancionero.songs`, keyed by song id = file name), only non-default
  values; entries of songs that no longer exist are pruned on load.
- Restored on load (`transpose.js`, `songSetting`). A book-wide chords/columns
  toggle clears the saved per-song overrides of that kind.
- Menu: *Song changes → Reset all*.
- `scratch/ui_test.py`: 7 new persistence checks (Abba Padre +3 survives reload with
  chords aligned, per-song chords/columns restored, global toggle clears, reset);
  full suite passes in Chromium and WebKit.
- Merged as PR #4 and deployed (live file verified identical).

## 2026-10-11 — Sing Session

- `web/js/session.js`: ordered list of song ids in localStorage (`cancionero.session`),
  deduplicated, pruned of songs that no longer exist. Shown first in the menu
  (`<details id="session" open>`): count, empty message, numbered list with
  link + ↑ ↓ ✕, own search box, Clear session (with confirmation).
- Every song gets a "+ Session" / "✓ In session" toggle button.
- `search.js` generalized: `data-search="<action>"` makes results action buttons
  (session box adds songs and stays focused); top-bar search unchanged.
- Build adds `data-title` to each song (plain title for the session list).
- `scratch/ui_test.py`: 16 new session checks; full suite passes in Chromium and WebKit.
- Merged as PR #5 and deployed (live file verified identical).

## 2026-10-11 — Drag and drop in Sing Session

- ↑ ↓ buttons replaced by a ⠿ handle on the right of each row
  (`web/js/session-drag.js`): pointer events (mouse/finger/pencil), handle has
  `touch-action: none` so only drags from it reorder and swipes elsewhere scroll the
  menu; dragged row lifts and follows, others slide aside; saved on release;
  pointercancel reverts; holding near the menu edge scrolls it; ↑/↓ keys on a
  focused handle. Position numbers hidden while dragging.
- `moveInSession(id, to)` now moves to a position.
- Tests: mouse drags (both engines), real touch drag via Chrome DevTools touch
  events, swipe on a title doesn't reorder, tap without move does nothing,
  keyboard, edge auto-scroll with a 20-song session; full suite passes.
- Merged as PR #6 and deployed (live file verified identical).

## 2026-10-11 — Printing: unfolded index, clickable PDF links

- Interpreted "the menu should always be open" as the Contenido index (the ☰ drawer
  is hidden on paper). `print.js`: on `beforeprint` every folded index section is
  opened, `afterprint` restores the user's folds; CSS fallback via
  `::details-content` in `@media print`; no ▼ markers on paper.
- Links: index/All Songs entries become internal PDF links (Chrome), song *Link*s
  stay web links. Found `cordero_de_dios_popular.md` with capo text in `link`
  ("0, 0-5" -> became a broken file:// link); moved to `capo`. Build now rejects
  links not starting with http(s)://.
- `scratch/pdf_test.py` (Chromium printToPDF + pypdf): folded sections printed,
  584/584 internal links resolve (first one lands on the song's page), 138 web
  links, folds restored after printing. Full UI suite passes.
- Not verifiable here: Safari/iOS's own PDF export (Playwright can't print WebKit).
- Merged as PR #7 and deployed (live file verified identical).

## 2026-10-11 — Each song starts on a new printed page

- Print CSS: `.song { break-before: page }` replaces `break-inside: avoid` (which,
  for songs not fitting the remaining space, left titles at the bottom of a page);
  title and meta line get `break-after: avoid`.
- `scratch/pdf_test.py` now checks every song heading is the first line of its own
  page, in order, with no page holding two song starts, for default print and for
  2 columns + no chords. Confirmed it FAILS on the previous build (146/150 and
  71/150) and passes now (150/150 both). Takes an optional path to a built page.

## 2026-10-11 — Pinch-zoom top bar: tried and reverted

- PR #9 kept the top bar and menu at normal size on screen while pinch-zoomed
  (visualViewport + a counter-scaling transform). Automated Chromium tests passed, but on
  the user's real device it felt buggy and crashed the page, so it was reverted (PR #10).
  The code is back to the PR #8 state. Test kept in `scratch/zoom_test.py`.
- Lesson: pinch-zoom behaviour must be judged on the real phone/iPad; headless tests
  do not reproduce iOS Safari's zoom.

## 2026-10-11 — Spanish alphabetical order

- `builder/songs.py`: `spanish_sort_key` ignores accents and case (é = e, ü = u) and keeps
  ñ as its own letter after n. Previously accented letters sorted after z, so e.g. Déjate
  came after Dulce locura. 16 songs renumbered (Déjate, Quédate Señor, Ven Espíritu...);
  saved per-song changes and the session are keyed by file name, so unaffected.
- `scratch/sort_check.py`: key unit checks + list of moved songs. Full UI and PDF suites pass.

## 2026-10-11 — Better search

- `web/js/search.js`: searches lyric lines only (before, chord lines were glued to the
  lyrics, so phrases across lines failed and chord names matched), plus title, author
  (`data-autor`, added by `builder/render.py`) and song number. Accents, case and
  punctuation ignored; every typed word must appear, in any order, prefixes OK. Ranked:
  number, title start, title, author, exact phrase in lyrics, scattered words. Lyric
  matches show the matching line (`.search-snippet`). No extra data in the file.
- `scratch/search_test.py`: old vs new on real queries ("padre abba" 0 -> 1, "senor,
  jesus" 0 -> 16, phrase across two lines 0 -> 1, "31" -> song 31 only), ranking,
  snippets, session box, and speed: slowest keystroke 10 ms with 6x slower CPU.

## 2026-10-11 — add_song.py: import songs from a link or paste

- `add_song.py` (interactive) + `importer/` package: link (Ultimate Guitar, Cifra Club,
  LaCuerda, generic <pre> sites, or a saved page file) or pasted text -> cleanup ->
  preview -> title/author/capo/Spotify/tags -> `songs/<title>_<author>.md` -> rebuild.
- Cleanup (`importer/clean.py`): tabs -> spaces at 8-column browser stops, 1:1 fixes for
  quotes/dashes/nbsp/sharps, invisible chars removed, NFC; section labels removed except
  intro (`Intro:` + chords; if none, `Intro:` + first chord, as in the existing songs);
  capo lines -> capo field; key/tuning/credit lines dropped; blank lines collapsed;
  unusual characters and unrecognised chords reported.
- Spanish chords (`importer/chords.py`): DO/Do/do + #/b + suffix + /bass -> letters;
  lower case = minor only when mixed with ALL-CAPS majors ("DO mi"). Chords keep their
  start column; a longer name (º -> dim) borrows following spaces. Doubtful pasted lines
  ("La la la") are asked about.
- Sites: UG embedded JSON ([ch] markup); Cifra Club <pre> with <b> chords, capo and artist
  from embedded data; it blocks non-browsers (Akamai), so it is read with headless WebKit
  (Playwright), which the script offers to install on first use; LaCuerda <pre> with <A>
  chords (song page -> first .shtml version).
- Author aliases remembered in `author_aliases.yaml` (seeded: Hakuna Group Music -> Hakuna).
- `scratch/add_song_test.py [--network]`: 50 checks (chord conversion and columns, chars,
  tabs, labels, capo, intro, paste detection, end-to-end runs on saved pages from all three
  sites, duplicates, aliases, live downloads). All pass.
- Choices: kept Spotify-only links (source page not stored); a removed label leaves a
  verse break; doubtful chord lines default to "yes" when Enter is pressed.

## 2026-10-11 — add_song.py option 3: search by title and artist

- `importer/search.py`: DuckDuckGo plain-HTML search ("<title> <artist> acordes"; Google and
  Bing only answer real browsers) + Ultimate Guitar's own search (Chords, artist match, most
  voted first) as a second source. Drops results not mentioning the title/artist, merges the
  same page under other addresses (UG tab ids, LaCuerda acordes./chords./.shtml, Cifra
  .com/.com.br), max 3 per site, supported sites first in `SITES` order (now UG, LaCuerda,
  Cifra Club: Cifra needs the browser engine, so last).
- `add_song.py`: option 3 lists up to 8 results; Enter takes the first untried; a page that
  can't be read, or a preview answered "no", goes back to the list (tried ones marked).
- Generic reader now refuses pages without chords (akordes, bananacifras draw them with
  JS); downloads detect the page's charset (losacordes.com is Windows-1252).
- Tests: 6 offline ranking checks (fake search answers) + 5 live option-3 checks in
  `scratch/add_song_test.py --network`; all 61 pass.

## 2026-10-11 — add_song.py finds the Spotify link

- `importer/spotify.py`: Spotify's API needs credentials, so DuckDuckGo is searched for
  open.spotify.com track links ("<title> <artist> spotify", then site: query only if no
  tracks). Search titles are cut off or stale (one track id showed as "Gull Catchers" and
  as "Huracán"), so every track is checked on Spotify's embed page (real title + artists):
  all title words must match and, unless the author is "popular", an artist word. Exact
  title first; up to 3 offered. Links stored as https://open.spotify.com/track/<id>.
- `add_song.py`: the Spotify question shows the tracks found; Enter = first, number, `-`
  for none, or a pasted link. `--offline` skips the lookup (used by tests).
- DuckDuckGo shows a "prove you're human" page after a burst of searches (hit while
  evaluating 40 searches in a row; lifted within minutes). Now detected and reported as
  "search busy, try again in a few minutes" instead of "nothing found".
- Tests: 5 offline Spotify checks with fake answers + live run (Huracán link found);
  all 67 checks pass. Measured against songs already linked: see below.
- Measured on 20 songs that already have a Spotify link (one every 20 s, like real use):
  the same track offered first for 10, among the 3 offered for 2, the same song by the
  same artist (another release) for 3, nothing found for 5 (e.g. "10000 razones" is
  "10,000 Reasons" on Spotify); never a wrong song.

## 2026-10-11 — README for newcomers

- Rewrote the top of `README.md`: what the project is, a Quick start table (setup, add a
  song, rebuild, preview, publish), Setup with prerequisites (Python 3.10+ (needed for
  `X | None` annotations), Git, GitHub write access) and plain `git clone` instead of
  `gh`, Windows paths, a Publishing section, the add_song.py walkthrough (all 3 options,
  Spotify, aliases, Cifra Club browser, doubtful lines, busy search), Troubleshooting.
  Developer details kept under "How it works".
- Verified the setup steps on a fresh clone in scratch/ (clone, venv, install, build,
  add_song.py --help): all work. `requirements.txt` got its missing final newline.

## 2026-10-12 — Chords added to lyrics-only songs (PR, not merged: user reviews first)

- User's rules: Checked.txt top list never touched; songs with chords left alone; TODO section
  and half-done songs processed too; keep the user's lyrics exactly and only insert chord lines
  above lines without chords that match the web lyrics word for word; uncertain -> untouched.
- `scratch/fill_chords.py`: search -> read up to 5 versions -> pick the one matching most
  chord-less lines -> move each chord to the same word/letter of the user's line. Key: from
  the song's own chord lines (paired lines, else roots), else from chords named in a top
  note ("Capo 2 F C Dm A#"); can't tell -> uncertain. Needs >= 60% of lines and >= 3.
- Filled 7 (195 chord lines added, 0 lines changed, all recognised as chord lines):
  no_tengo_miedo (F, from the note), salmo_23 (C), jesucristo_basta (C), pescador_de_hombres
  (C), otra_vez, ven_ante_su_trono, el_dios_que_adoramos (their own keys).
- Uncertain, untouched (12), listed in Checked.txt under claude-uncertain with the reason:
  mostly no chord page online (niche songs), or too few matching lines.
- libre_miel_san_marcos: every line already has chords, nothing added.
- First pass put No tengo miedo in D although the note says F: fixed by reading note chords.

## 2026-10-12 — add_songs.py: add a list of songs without questions (PR, not merged)

- `add_songs.py LIST --section NAME --report FILE`: one song per line ("Title - Artist");
  per song: duplicate check -> search -> read up to 4 versions whose title has every typed
  word (and the artist, when given) and that have >= 4 chord lines over lyrics -> clean ->
  Spotify link, else YouTube (`importer/youtube.py`, checked with YouTube oEmbed) -> file
  with no tags. Uncertain (nothing created): already in the book, no matching page, or no
  artist given and pages by different artists. Results under claude-added / -uncertain.
- Title: the site's accents with the typed capitals ("Dios está aqui" -> "Dios está aquí").
  Author: remembered alias > book's spelling of the typed artist > site artist (not
  compilations like "Misc Praise Songs") > typed > popular.
- `importer/read.py`: shared non-interactive reader (redirects, browser when blocked);
  add_song.py uses it.
- Cleanup for web pages: contributor chatter dropped (greetings, e-mails, "música y letra",
  "dudas y comentarios"...), plus text before the first chord line and chord-less blocks after
  the last one (counted in the notes). Not for pasted text. UG search 404 = no results.
- First run stopped after 6 songs because of those problems; fixed and re-run from scratch.
- Want.txt run (Want section, 25 songs): 10 added (no tags; 9 Spotify links, 1 YouTube),
  15 uncertain: 2 already in the book (Yo quiero ser tu servidor; Ruah, maybe another song),
  7 no artist and pages by different artists, 6 no chord page found. All in Checked.txt.
- Further fixes found while reviewing: guitar tablature lines dropped; pages with blank lines
  inside verses joined; typed artist capitalised or spelled as an author already in the book
  (Trigo -> Trigo Trece); "popular" not searched as an artist. The 10 songs were regenerated.

## 2026-10-12 — Home-screen app opens offline (PR, not merged)

- Problem: on iPhone the Reading List copy works offline, but the home-screen app doesn't
  (it has its own storage and always loaded the page from the internet).
- `sw.js` (service worker, repo root): saves the book, manifest and icons; page requests get
  the newest book from the internet (and save it), or the saved copy when offline or after
  4 s of slow network. `web/js/offline.js` registers it only on http(s), so opening
  `index.html` as a file is unchanged and still makes no network requests.
- `manifest.webmanifest`, `icon-180.png`, `icon-512.png` (two notes on the accent colour,
  drawn with `scratch/make_icons.py`), links in `web/template.html`: name, icon, full screen.
- Choice: stacked on the add-songs branch so the built `index.html` doesn't conflict.
- Checks: `scratch/offline_test.py` (Chromium airplane mode; Chromium and WebKit with the
  server switched off, since Playwright's WebKit can't go offline with a service worker):
  opens offline, any address of the book, newest book shown and saved when back online,
  file:// unaffected, no JS errors. Full `scratch/ui_test.py` passes. Real iPhone still to
  be tried by the user.
